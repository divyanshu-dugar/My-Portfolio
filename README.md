# My Portfolio  

Hey folks! 👋 Welcome to my Portfolio Repository. This project showcases my skills and creativity in web development through a fully functional and responsive webpage.  

## 🔧 Tech Stack  
- **MongoDB**: For database management and storing application data.  
- **Express.js**: For backend development and creating RESTful APIs.  
- **Node.js**: For server-side development and managing application logic.  
- **EJS**: For rendering dynamic HTML views using server-side templates.

## 🚧 In Progress  
I'm currently working on recoding my portfolio using **Next.js** for improved performance, SEO, and scalability.
